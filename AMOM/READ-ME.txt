using the "look around" command is VITAL. it will let you know that is happinging in the location you are in, and give you details on what items are in it, what items can be used in it, and what areas you can go to from your current location.


GETTING ITEMS
type in "grab 'name of the item'" to add the item to your inventory. you dont have a limited inventory so you do not need to drop anything.
the game DOES include a drop command however, but it is not recommended and my hinder your progess.(blame this game's lazy programmer). if you do drop an item, you will have to go back to the place it was found in to get it.
some items will need to be examined in order to know how to use them or the purpose they serve.
