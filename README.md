# Projects
This is a collection of projects that I have done. including a text based adventure game, an asteroid dodging game, and a calculator, 


The LightRunner Project is still in need of touch-ups. I still need to add the menu screens, and fix the boundry collision so that the light does not reset every time a boundry is touhed.
